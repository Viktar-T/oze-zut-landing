## Data Acquisition System

### Current Situation

The system is already connected to a small on-board PC. The PC communicates with the measurement hardware via RS-485. It runs a proprietary software interface that displays system data on a dedicated screen. Full data access currently requires login credentials (username and password unknown).

### Recommendations

- Obtain software login credentials to view data parameters
- Once logged in, data may be exportable or streamable
- If needed, connect the PC to the LAN

## Features

- Algae cultivation
- Controlled growth environment
- Biofuel production research
- Biomass generation
- Monitoring and control systems
- Educational and research applications
